Description: Assorted tools for genetic and pharmacogenetic association analyses.  There are functions for simplifying and standardising pharmacogenetic analysis and reporting.  There are functions to support multi-SNP risk score analyses, multi-SNP conditional regression analyses, and multi-phenotype analyses, using summary statistics instead of using subject-specific data.  There are helper functions for reading and manipulating subject-specific genotype data, which provide a platform for calculating the summary statistics, or for using R to conduct other analyses not supported by specific GWAS analysis tools.
